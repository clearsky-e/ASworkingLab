        <h1>Welcome to ASworkingLab</h1>
        <p>I'm the web architect behind ASworkingLab, a portfolio showcasing my web development prowess. Whether you need a lightning-fast PERN stack application or a visually stunning MERN creation, I'm your guy.
            
            But my talents extend beyond the digital realm. When I'm not wrangling code, you'll find me on the field, tearing it up in a game of football or badminton.  If the weather's nice, I might be cruising around on my bike, soaking up the sunshine.
            
            In the evenings, I unwind with a classic Marvel movie marathon (Team Iron Man, all the way!).  And to keep my mind sharp, I love a good game of chess.
            
            So, that's the abridged version of me! If you're interested in the nitty-gritty professional stuff, come here (but beware, it might be a little less exciting ).
            
            For a more professional introduction of mine,

            <h1 style=" text-align: center;">Beyond the Code</h1>
            <p style="text-align: center;"> I'm also fueled by friendly competition and a love for the outdoors. There's more to life than lines of code, and I'm out there exploring it!

                    <p style="color: white; font-weight: bolder;">

                        I absolutely love playing football! In fact, the first game I ever played was football. I play as the striker . Besides football, I also have a passion for badminton, which I started playing in 2020. My favorite football player is <a style="color: black; text-decoration: none;" href="https://www.instagram.com/leomessi/?hl=en">Messi</a>  (yes, the legend himself). <br> 
                        But when I need a mental challenge, I trade my cleats for the strategic world of chess, a fantastic way to sharpen my focus and problem-solving skills.
                        <br> One of my favorite games of his is an absolute must-watch. Don't believe me? <a style="color: black; text-decoration: none;" href="https://youtu.be/sjMofjmzQKU?si=cpR9JxUAC5_vwp6r">Watch this!</a>

                        I am absolutely passionate about music and songs—they are my ultimate healers. I can listen to tunes almost all the time. My ears are constantly blessed by the sounds of Ed Sheeran, Alec Benjamin, and the legendary KK. But wait, there's more! I also groove to some amazing indie artists like Aditya Rikhari and Vayu.

                        From winning writing competitions as a kid to crafting my own comic book stories, I've been weaving tales since the 8th grade. My love for creating fictional characters and spinning stories only grew, and by the 12th grade, I had a whole library of adventures penned down. Writing is my escape, my playground, and my superpower!
